            <h2>History of the Calculator</h2>
            <p>
                The history of the calculator dates back thousands of years to early counting tools like the abacus, used by civilizations such as the Babylonians and Chinese. However, the first mechanical calculator was invented in 1642 by Blaise Pascal, a French mathematician and philosopher. His device, called the Pascaline, could perform basic addition and subtraction. Later, in the 17th century, German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz improved upon this by developing a stepped drum mechanism capable of multiplication and division. 
    
                The 19th century saw further advancements with Charles Babbage, an English mathematician, who conceptualized the Difference Engine and later the Analytical Engine, considered precursors to modern computers. In 1887, Dorr Felt introduced the Comptometer, the first key-driven mechanical calculator, which was widely used in businesses. By the early 20th century, companies like Burroughs, Monroe, and IBM were mass-producing mechanical calculators. 
    
                The 1960s marked the beginning of the electronic calculator era with the introduction of transistor-based machines. Companies like Texas Instruments and Casio revolutionized the industry by producing compact, battery-powered devices. By the 1970s, the first pocket calculators became widely available, making arithmetic operations faster and more accessible. 
    
                As technology advanced, scientific calculators emerged, allowing engineers and students to perform complex functions like trigonometry, logarithms, and statistical calculations. Graphing calculators followed, integrating advanced computational capabilities, programmability, and even gaming functions. Today, modern calculators exist in smartphones and computers, reducing the need for standalone devices. However, their legacy remains as an essential tool in education, engineering, and finance. The evolution of the calculator reflects humanityâ€™s continuous pursuit of efficiency in computation and problem-solving.
